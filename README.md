### In this Challenge, you’ll assume the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Your firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, your firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.

The speed of these transactions gave your firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. You’re thus planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm’s competitive advantage in the market. To do so, you’ll enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

### Comparing the Results
### SVM Model

The SVM Model reports the precision for -1.0 is 1.0 and for 1.0 is 0.63. The acutal returns is not as good as the trategy returns. In 2018 the actual returns is a little bit higher than strategy returns.

### Logistic Regression Model

The logistic regression model reports the precision for -1.0 is 0.88 which is lower than the SVM model, the score for 1.0 is 0.65 which higher than the SVM model. Actual returns perform better than the strategy returns in 2018 and 2021.

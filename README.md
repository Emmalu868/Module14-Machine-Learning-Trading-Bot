### In this Challenge, you’ll assume the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Your firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, your firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.

The speed of these transactions gave your firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. You’re thus planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm’s competitive advantage in the market. To do so, you’ll enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

### Comparing the Results
### SVM Model

### Logistic Regression Model

The SVM Model shows a gradually increase from 2016 to 2018 where strategy returns and actual returns are overlap. After 2018, actual returns are running lower than actual returns with the same trend over the time and the difference is gapping bigger. The lowest point for actual returns is 2020 at 0.8. The highest actual returns are 1.4 and strategy returns are 1.5 athe the same point in 2021

The logistic regression model has the same performance before 2018 with the SVM model. In 2018 the actual returns are flactuating higher than strategy returns till mid 2018. And then strategy returns across higher than actual returns with the peak at 1.5 in the late 2020. The actual returns peak at 1.4 in 2021 post strategy-return-peak.
Both bottom points are in 2020, the actual returns are a lot lower than strategy returns at 0.8 vs 1.0.
